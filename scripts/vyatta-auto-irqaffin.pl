# Description: Script to configure optimal IRQ affinity for NICs.
#
# **** End License ****
#

# This script attempts to set up a static CPU affinity for the IRQs
# used by network interfaces.  It is primarily targeted at supporting
# multi-queue NICs, but does include code to handle single-queue NICs.
# Since different NICs may have different queue organizations, and
# because there is no standard API for learning the mapping between
# queues and IRQ numbers, different code is required for each of the
# queue naming conventions.
#
# The general strategy involves trying to achieve the following goals:
#
#  - Spread the receive load among as many CPUs as possible.
#    
#  - For all multi-queue NICs in the system that provide both tx and
#    rx queues, keep all of the queues that share the same queue
#    number on same CPUs.  I.e. tx and rx queue 0 of all such NICs
#    should interrupt one CPU; tx and rx queue 1 should interrupt a
#    different CPU, etc.
#    
#  - If hyperthreading is supported and enabled, avoid assigning
#    queues to both CPUs of a hyperthreaded pair if there are enough
#    CPUs available to do that.
#
# This strategy yields the greatest MP scaling possible for
# multi-queue NICs.  It also ensures that an individual skb is
# processed on the same CPU for the entirity of its lifecycle,
# including transmit time, which optimally utilizes the cache and
# keeps performance high.

# Affinity assignment function for the Intel igb, ixgb and ixgbe

# The first part of the strategy for optimal performance is to select
# the CPU to assign the IRQs to by mapping from the queue number.
# This ensures that all queues with the same queue number are assigned
# to the same CPU.  The second part is to avoid assigning any queues
# to the second CPU in a hyper-threaded pair, if posible.  I.e., if
# CPU 0 and 1 are hyper-threaded pairs, then assign a queue to CPU 0,
# but try to avoid assigning one to to CPU 1.  But if we have more
# queues than CPUs, then it is OK to assign some to the second CPU in
# a hyperthreaded pair.
